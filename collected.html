        How People Wear Masks
        </a>

      <p class="reference-note">
        The film helped me understand the difference between persona and self. 
        The mask represents adaptation, while what lies beneath holds uncertainty and desire. 
        It showed me that becoming whole means living without confusing the role for the reality.

        The Learning Pit
    </a>

    <p class="reference-note">
        The Learning Pit video showed me that real learning isn't straight or easy; it often feels like falling into confusion and struggling upward. 
        It taught me that struggle isn't a sign of failure, but a normal and even productive part of growth. 
        That insight changed how I think about learning, effort, and challenge: rather than avoiding difficulty, I can see it as a path leading to deeper understanding.

        Aladdin
        </a>

      <p class="reference-note">
        I came to see Aladdin as a story about ego, desire, and integration. 
        It helped me understand how easily we confuse worth with image, and power with authenticity. 
        The story shaped me by showing that growth is not about acquiring identity, but uncovering it.

    The American Way: Our Connection to Nazi Germany
  </a>

  <p class="reference-note">
    This video made me question how education shapes identity before it teaches understanding. 
    It showed me how nationalism and obedience can be quietly normalized, not through force, 
    but through repetition and ritual. It stayed with me because it reframed schooling as 
    conditioning, not just learning.
