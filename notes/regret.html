        <h1>Regret</h1>

        <p>
          Would I go back in time and change the things I regret?
        </p>

        <p>
          Would any of those people be happy to see me?
        </p>

        <p>
          If I lost something,
          would it still hold the same value
          that I once thought it did?
        </p>

        <p>
          There aren't many points in my life
          that I would want to revisit.
          I know it wouldn't last 
          so why be happy in that moment
          only to have it taken away again?
        </p>

        <p>
          Why go through that pain twice?
          There's no point in it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Would I be able to read a letter from my future self,
          or would there be no one left to write it?
        </p>

        <p>
          And even if I could read it,
          would I understand what it said?
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now,
          I can't seem to see a future
          where I am happy.
        </p>

        <p>
          What part of my stupid life
          should I change
          to make it meaningful?
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many words in the dictionary,
          but I can't find one
          that defines me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where is it?
        </p>

        <p>
          What is my purpose
          in being here
          feeling this pain
          for a reason
          I can't even figure out?
        </p>

        <p>
          What am I still doing here?
        </p>
