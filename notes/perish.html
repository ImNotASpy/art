        <p>
          I have come to terms that I will perish never seeing
          the light of champion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some people are meant to do great things -
          near unstoppable in their resolve to leave
          the legacy of their accomplishments
          for the world to see.
        </p>

        <p>
          Others, like me, are mere stairs,
          meant to serve as platforms
          for those who would achieve things
          beyond the capabilities of those like myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's noble to know one's place,
          I presume.
        </p>
