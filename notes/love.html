        <p>
        If you are trying to love yourself, that already means you do.
        </p>

        <p>
        There is an idea that loving yourself is dangerous. 
        That if you accept who you are now, you will stop wanting to grow. 
        That if you hate where you are, you should hate yourself until you are better. 
        But that has never been how love works.
        </p>

        <p>
        When someone truly loves you, they do not want you frozen in time. 
        They love who you are and who you are becoming. 
        Growth does not come from rejection. It comes from care.
        </p>

        <p>
        The truth is, you have probably been loving yourself longer than you realize. 
        Every time you survived something hard. Every time you tried again. 
        Every time you searched for understanding instead of giving up. 
        That was not self hatred. That was effort, protection, and persistence.
        </p>

        <p>
        We are taught to judge our past selves. To see them as failures or mistakes that need to be erased. 
        But your past self did not ruin your life. They carried it forward. 
        Every choice they made, especially the painful ones, was the best they could do with what they had at the time. 
        Their pain became your awareness. Their mistakes became your information.
        </p>

        <p>
        Acknowledging those moments does not mean excusing them. It means recognizing their value. 
        They were not worthless. They were raw material. 
        When you look at them with honesty instead of shame, you can turn them into something stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
        You might feel limited right now by your emotions, your circumstances, or what you do not yet know. That is okay. 
        Future you will have more tools. More clarity. More resources. 
        Everything you are learning now is something you are already sending forward to them.
        </p>

        <p>
        Loving yourself is not something you earn one day when you are fixed. It is something that has already been happening, whether you notice it or not. 
        It lives in your survival, your reflection, your desire to do better.
        </p>

        <p>
        Your past is not here to convict you. It is trying to teach you. If you are willing to sit with it, really sit with it, what once felt like suffering can become growth.
        </p>

        <p>
        Not easily. Not quickly. But genuinely.
