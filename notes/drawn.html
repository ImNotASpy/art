          Then you will continually be in pain, because it certainly is.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is too much to ask a fish to do something as simple as breathe.
          Never forget the limitations of each being, and how they came to be.
          It is wrong to ask a fish to breathe because its life is in the water,
          not the land.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is too much to ask honesty from those who cannot experience it,
          for they have not, or cannot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ours is not to ask “why are you hurting me,"
          but “why are you drawn to hurt."
