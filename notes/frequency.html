        <p>
          Frequency is a number of actions in time.
          The quantum is the most simple value system.
          It is a wave in time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mass is a property of energy.
          Energy is action.
          Force is interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Staring at your belly button is romance.
          We all eat and poo.
          We are animals.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have the sense of order.
          Order has values.
          Values are in order.
        </p>

        <p>
          Values are matters of consideration,
          matters of importance,
          numbers and actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can sit and think and drink and wee.
          Wee - aren't we all having a good time
          as our genes set the values.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have all heard the same romance
          as we dance.
          Frequently, frequency is raved and paved
          to nothing but staring at the belly button.
          Nuttin'.
        </p>

        <p>
          The key to the lock is information.
          Information is patterns of randomness and order 
          disorganised complexity
          and organised complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Too much information.
          We reduce values.
        </p>

        <p>
          E needs m to express itself.
          Mass is a property of E.
          We can't do nuttin without m.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can romance,
          after we go to the toilet,
          wash our hands and face,
          and have breakfast 
          or fast slowly.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has all been said and done before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later, we will be hungry for information.
          Will we really die?
          It sure looks like we will.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cancer affects some people more than others
          because of their genetics.
          They have no choice,
          but we all want to survive.
