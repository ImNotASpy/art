      <h1>Holding Space</h1>

      <p>
        I don't think we should be looking for someone else to heal us.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I do think there's a real problem in how our society,
        and even our friendships and relationships,
        handle emotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        It feels like we've forgotten how to hold space for each other.
        People are expected to be positive all the time,
        and when someone expresses sadness or frustration,
        others shut down or tell them to go to therapy
        instead of simply listening.
      </p>

      <p>
        That'
        
        
        s not what friendship or connection is supposed to be,
        in my opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's as if we've become too self focused,
        only wanting others around when they're happy or easy.
        And that's sad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because it means we're losing the skills
        that make us empathetic, supportive people.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we never practice holding space
        for the people around us,
        their grief, anger, fear, and pain,
        then we are not really building community.
      </p>
