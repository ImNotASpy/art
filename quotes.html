    Lost.<br><br>

    Stand still. The trees ahead and bushes beside you<br>
    Are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here,<br>
    And you must treat it as a powerful stranger,<br>
    Must ask permission to know it and be known.<br>
    <br>
    The forest breathes. Listen. It answers,<br>
    I have made this place around you.<br>
    If you leave it, you may come back again, saying Here.<br>
    <br>
    No two trees are the same to Raven.<br>
    No two branches are the same to Wren.<br>
    If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you,<br>
    You are surely lost.<br>
    <br>
    Stand still. The forest knows<br>
    Where you are. You must let it find you.
