      <p>
        Some people feel at ease<br>
        without knowing why.
      </p>

      <p>
        Others pause at the edge,<br>
        sensing depth beneath the surface,<br>
        unsure whether to step in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depth asks for discomfort.<br>
        It asks for stillness long enough<br>
        to notice what stirs beneath the calm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Presence with the self<br>
        makes space for another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some step forward<br>
        and stay with it<br>
        long enough<br>
        to find their balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some leave not only because the water is cold,<br>
        but because the distance is forgiving.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is missed is not intensity,<br>
        but resonance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The quiet understanding<br>
        that forms when two depths meet,<br>
        and neither needs to flee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two people may stand close,<br>
        yet never meet.
      </p>

      <p>
        What's missing is not closeness,<br>
        it's the moment<br>
        where something real<br>
        could have stayed.
      </p>
