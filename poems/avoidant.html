      <div class="work-body">

        <p>
          Avoidance is labeled as wrong,<br>
          as hatred, as cold.<br>
          But it's fear, really.
        </p>

        <p>
          Change comes through awareness,<br>
          but the anxiety always hits first.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know I'm not the only one<br>
          to push through that panic<br>
          just to feel love.
        </p>

        <p>
          What an ache it is,<br>
          to have what you want<br>
          right in front of you<br>
          but never be able to touch it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The heart builds an electric fence,<br>
          and I flinch at every pulse.
        </p>

        <p>
          I see closeness in others:<br>
          the love, joy, laughter, vulnerability.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I wonder,<br>
          how amazing would that feel,<br>
          if only I could let myself?
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, the cycle repeats:<br>
          get close.<br>
          feel safe.<br>
          then fear.<br>
          then flee.
        </p>

        <p class="pause">
          Too close.<br>
          Too much.<br>
          Too tight.
        </p>

        <p>
          The avoidant in me,<br>
          it always triggers.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I try to stay,<br>
          I get physically ill:
        </p>

        <p>
          lump in my throat,<br>
          tight chest,<br>
          nausea,<br>
          shivers for days.
        </p>

        <p>
          Closeness feels like drowning.<br>
          Like I'm being buried alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          The anxiety screams:<br>
          run.<br>
          run far away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Isolation becomes my peace.<br>
          Darkness, my comfort.
        </p>

        <p>
          I vanish, unseen,<br>
          safe from the eyes of love.
        </p>

        <p>
          The avoidant in me asks,<br>
          “Why do you want to see me?”
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't you know?<br>
          I am damage.<br>
          I am ruthless.<br>
          I am stone.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hurt those who care.<br>
          Alone is the only way I know how to survive.
        </p>

        <p>
          But they say, stronger as a pair.<br>
          And I wonder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Will the damage I cause ever end?
        </p>

        <p>
          The sadness in their voices,<br>
          the loneliness in their eyes,<br>
          they confirm what I fear:
        </p>

        <p class="pause">
          I am the damage.
        </p>

        <p>
          My need to be alone<br>
          creates their isolation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chaos follows me.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I can't even look you in the eye,<br>
          because it feels like I might die.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your love makes me sick.<br>
          Literally.
        </p>

        <p>
          So sick I can't move.<br>
          So sick I lose my hunger.
        </p>

        <p>
          They say love cures all,<br>
          but for me,<br>
          love is a sickness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes I wish there was a cure.<br>
          An antidote<br>
          to take this all away.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the only thing I can do<br>
          is isolate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Slip into the shadows.<br>
          Hide from everyone and everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          Isolation feels like the only cure<br>
          for this disease called love.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do I want to escape this cage?<br>
          I don't know.
        </p>

        <p>
          The warmth of being alone<br>
          feels so natural.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why does the world revolve around closeness?
        </p>

        <p>
          Why does distance hurt them,<br>
          but heal me?
        </p>

        <p class="pause">
          What they call love,<br>
          I call pain.
        </p>
